## query-formatter README

## NOTE:
** THIS EXTENSION IS HELPFUL FOR DEBUGGING LOGICAL ERRORS ONLY. **

## Features
This extension is made for formatting object strings of Lucene Queries. These object strings are one liner
which can contain thousands of words in case of complex queries due to which it becomes a cumbersome task
to read and debug manually but with this formatter you can prettify your object and get a better readability
of queries. This extension can be very handy for engineers working in large organisations with Elastic Search database in JAVA.

## Key Bindings

For Non-Mac: "shift+ctrl+i"

            OR

For Non-Mac: "shift+ctrl+p" -> "Format Query"
